EDD Code Snippet Library
========================

This is a community-maintained repository of code snippets that help modify the default behavior of [Easy Digital Downloads](https://easydigitaldownloads.com).

Snippets are organized into categories (folders) and each snippet is placed in its own file with a name that describes what it does.

## Using Snippets

Most files in this library are set up to be WordPress plugins:

1. Navigate to the [EDD Library site](http://library.easydigitaldownloads.com).
2. Browse and locate the snippet you'd like to use. Each file is set up to be a WordPress plugin.
3. Copy the code snippet from the page and paste it into a new, empty WordPress plugin.
4. Activate the plugin from the WordPress plugins page.

If you need help customising any of the snippets or do not understand how to use them, we recommend [hiring an EDD consultant](https://easydigitaldownloads.com/consultants/).
