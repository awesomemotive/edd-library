EDD Code Snippet Library
========================

This is a community-maintained repository of code snippets that help modify the default behavior of [Easy Digital Downloads](https://easydigitaldownloads.com).

Snippets are organized into categories (folders) and each snippet is placed in its own file with a name that describes what it does.

## Using Snippets

Most files in this library are set up to be WordPress plugins:

1. Click on the filename of the snippet you'd like to use.
2. Click the "Raw" button (next to "Blame" and "History") at the top right.
3. Save the page from your browser to your wp-content/plugins folder and upload to your server. Alternatively you can compress the file as a .zip file and upload as a plugin from within WordPress. 
4. Activate the plugin from the WordPress plugins page.

For files that aren't set up as plugins follow steps 1 and 2 above and then copy and paste the code into your child theme's functions.php or place inside a custom functionality plugin.

If you need help customising any of the snippets or do not understand how to use them, we recommend [hiring an EDD consultant](https://easydigitaldownloads.com/consultants/).

## Submitting Your Snippet

We welcome and encourage everyone to submit their code snippets. If you would like to submit your snippet, please [fork](https://github.com/easydigitaldownloads/library/fork) the repository and then create a [pull request](https://github.com/easydigitaldownloads/library/compare/).

## Notes

This is not a tutorial archive. Please see the [tutorials section](https://easydigitaldownloads.com/docs/section/tutorials/) of the EDD website if you're looking for instructions on how to implement these snippets (and others).

These snippets come with no guarantees. Due to the constant evolution of the EDD codebase, it is possible that the behavior of these snippets may change overtime. Find something broken? [Let us know](https://github.com/easydigitaldownloads/library/issues)!
