    <p>This is a community-maintained repository of code snippets that help modify the default behavior of <a href="https://easydigitaldownloads.com">Easy Digital Downloads</a>.</p>

    <p>Snippets are organized into categories (folders) and each snippet is placed in its own file with a name that describes what it does.</p>

    <h2>Using Snippets</h2>

    Most files in this library are set up to be WordPress plugins:

    <ol>
        <li>Browse the categories in the main menu above to find the snippet you need.</li>
        <li>Use the <a href="https://wpcode.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WPCode.com</a> plugin to <a href="https://wpcode.com/docs/how-to-create-your-first-snippet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">add snippets</a> to your site.</li>
    </ol>

    If you need help customising any of the snippets or do not understand how to use them, we recommend using <a href="https://easydigitaldownloads.com/customize-easy-digital-downloads/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Codeable</a> as a trusted source for customizing your Easy Digital Downloads Store.

    <h2>Notes</h2>
